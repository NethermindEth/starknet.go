# ExecuteTransaction

Executes a sponsored transaction through the paymaster service. Submits the sponsored transaction to the Starknet network, with transaction fees paid by the paymaster service according to the terms established in BuildTransaction.

## Method Signature

```go
func (pm *Paymaster) ExecuteTransaction(
    ctx context.Context,
    request *ExecuteTransactionRequest,
) (ExecuteTransactionResponse, error)
```

**Source:** [execute_txn.go:L21-L45](https://github.com/NethermindEth/starknet.go/blob/main/paymaster/execute_txn.go#L21-L45)

## Parameters

- `ctx` (context.Context): Context for the operation
- `request` (*ExecuteTransactionRequest): Transaction execution request containing signed typed data

## Returns

- `ExecuteTransactionResponse`: Response containing tracking ID and transaction hash
- `error`: Error if execution fails

## Type Definitions

### ExecuteTransactionResponse

**Source:** [execute_txn.go:L85-L92](https://github.com/NethermindEth/starknet.go/blob/main/paymaster/execute_txn.go#L85-L92)

```go
type ExecuteTransactionResponse struct {
    TrackingID      *felt.Felt `json:"tracking_id"`
    TransactionHash *felt.Felt `json:"transaction_hash"`
}
```

**Fields:**
- `TrackingID` (*felt.Felt): A unique identifier used to track an execution request of a user. Its purpose is to track possibly different transactions sent by the paymaster and which are associated with a same user request
- `TransactionHash` (*felt.Felt): Hash of the transaction broadcasted by the paymaster

## Usage Example

- Submit sponsored transactions to the Starknet network after building with BuildTransaction.
- Execute gasless transactions where the paymaster covers all fees according to the terms established earlier.
- Monitor transaction submission by using the returned transaction hash with WaitForTransaction.
- Must call BuildTransaction first to get the properly formatted calls and paymaster data.
- Returns immediately after submission - use RPC provider's WaitForTransaction to wait for confirmation.
- TrackingID links the build and execute operations for the paymaster service to track the full flow.
