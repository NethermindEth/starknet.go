## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of Go modules and testing

### Environment Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starknet.go.git
   cd starknet.go
   ```

3. **Add upstream remote:**
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/NethermindEth/starknet.go.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```



### Development Workflow

We recommend the following workflow for contributors:

1. **Find an issue** to work on and use comments to communicate your intentions and ask questions
2. **Work in a feature branch** of your personal fork (github.com/YOUR_NAME/starknet.go) of the main repository (github.com/NethermindEth/starknet.go)
3. **Create a pull request** to merge your changes into the main repository after implementing the solution
4. **Wait for review** by repository maintainers to ensure the issue is addressed
5. **Merge approval** - if the issue is resolved, maintainers will merge your pull request

### Linter Requirements

Starknet.go requires linter checks to pass before merging. Follow these steps:

1. **Install golangci-lint:**
   ```bash
   go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@v1.60.0
   ```

2. **Run the linter:**
   ```bash
   golangci-lint run
   ```

3. **Run linter on specific files:**
   ```bash
   golangci-lint run path/to/your/file.go
   golangci-lint run path/to/your/directory
   ```

Ensure no linter errors exist before submitting your pull request.
