# Curve Types

The curve types submodule provides functionality for working with different types of curves in Starknet.

## Curve Types

The package supports various curve types:

- Stark curve
- Pedersen curve
- ECDSA curve

## Stark Curve

The Stark curve is the main curve used in Starknet. It is defined by the equation:

```
y² = x³ + αx + β
```

Where:
- α and β are constants
- The curve is defined over a prime field

### Creating a Stark Curve

```go
curve := curves.NewStarkCurve()
```

### Stark Curve Operations

```go
// Add two points
result := curve.Add(point1, point2)

// Multiply a point by a scalar
result := curve.Mul(point, scalar)

// Get the generator point
generator := curve.Generator()
```

## Pedersen Curve

The Pedersen curve is used for Pedersen hashing in Starknet. It is defined by the equation:

```
y² = x³ + αx + β
```

Where:
- α and β are constants
- The curve is defined over a prime field

### Creating a Pedersen Curve

```go
curve := curves.NewPedersenCurve()
```

### Pedersen Curve Operations

```go
// Add two points
result := curve.Add(point1, point2)

// Multiply a point by a scalar
result := curve.Mul(point, scalar)

// Get the generator point
generator := curve.Generator()
```

## ECDSA Curve

The ECDSA curve is used for ECDSA signatures in Starknet. It is defined by the equation:

```
y² = x³ + αx + β
```

Where:
- α and β are constants
- The curve is defined over a prime field

### Creating an ECDSA Curve

```go
curve := curves.NewECDSACurve()
```

### ECDSA Curve Operations

```go
// Add two points
result := curve.Add(point1, point2)

// Multiply a point by a scalar
result := curve.Mul(point, scalar)

// Get the generator point
generator := curve.Generator()
```

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a Stark curve
starkCurve := curves.NewStarkCurve()

// Create a Pedersen curve
pedersenCurve := curves.NewPedersenCurve()

// Create an ECDSA curve
ecdsaCurve := curves.NewECDSACurve()

// Add two points on the Stark curve
result := starkCurve.Add(point1, point2)

// Multiply a point by a scalar on the Pedersen curve
result := pedersenCurve.Mul(point, scalar)

// Get the generator point on the ECDSA curve
generator := ecdsaCurve.Generator()
```
